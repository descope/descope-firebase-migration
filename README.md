# Descope Firebase User Migration Tool

This repository includes a Python utility for migrating your Firebase users to Descope.

This tool will transfer the following information:

- **Users** - all user information, including custom attributes defined in Realtime Database or Firestore (if applicable)

## Setup üíø

1. Clone the Repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:descope/descope-firebase-migration.git
```

2. Create a Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the Necessary Python libraries

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download Firebase Credential Private Key

You'll need to download your Firebase Credential and put it in the `/creds` folder in order to give the Firebase Admin SDK access to your user table.

a. First, you'll need to open Settings > [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk), in the Firebase Console.

b. Click `Generate New Private Key`, then confirm by clicking `Generate Key`.

c. Securely store the JSON file containing the key, in the `/creds` folder, in the root of this repository.

> **Note**: You can read more about the setup process on the Firebase [docs page](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup).

5. Copy over Password Hash Parameters from Firebase Console

In order to successfully copy over the passwords over your users, you'll need to provide the password hash parameters that are specific to your Firebase project. You can find these in the Firebase Console, under Authentication -> Users.

<img width="700" alt="Monosnap test - Authentication with Identity Platform - Firebase console 2024-02-08 11-11-48" src="https://github.com/descope/descope-firebase-migration/assets/32936811/a938b920-f146-4756-a3ae-8c6c1cc971b7">

a. Under the three dots in the top right corner, you'll find the option for `Password hash parameters`. Click on it.

b. Once you've opened these up, copy these over to a `password-hash.txt` file and place it in the `/creds` folder, which you can see as an example [here](password-hash.txt.example).

After that, the migration tool will automatically recognize it and extract the necessary claims from the parameters JSON.

6. Setup Your Environment Variables

You can change the name of the `.env.example` file to `.env` to use as a template.

```
DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=<Descope Project ID>
DESCOPE_MANAGEMENT_KEY=<Descope Management Key>
FIREBASE_DB_URL=<Firebase Realtime DB URL> (Optional)
```

a. To get your Descope Project ID, go [here](https://app.descope.com/settings/project), then copy the token to your
`.env` file.

b. To create a Descope Management Key, go [here](https://app.descope.com/settings/company/managementkeys), then copy
the token to your `.env` file.

c. **OPTIONAL** - If you're using the Firebase Realtime Database, make sure that you include your `FIREBASE_DB_URL` in the `.env` file. This URL is required for the application to interact with your Firebase Database, enabling it to read and write data. If you do not use Realtime Database, you can skip to the `Step 6`.

To find your Firebase Realtime Database URL:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to `Realtime Database` in the `Develop` section.
4. Your database URL will be displayed at the top of the Database screen. It typically follows the format `https://<your-project-id>.firebaseio.com/`.

<img width="700" alt="Monosnap test - Realtime Database - Firebase console 2024-01-11 22-35-59" src="https://github.com/descope/descope-firebase-migration/assets/32936811/ce6b66a0-04b5-4824-829a-4e10e2754fe9">

> **Note**: If you're using the Firebase Realtime Database, make sure your rules allow the necessary read/write operations for your application.

7. The tool depends on a few custom user attributes you need to create within Descope to assist you with the migration. The below outlines the machine names of the attributes to create within the [user's custom attributes](https://app.descope.com/users/attributes) section of the Descope console.

- `freshlyMigrated` (type: Boolean): This custom attribute will be set to true during the migration. This allows for you
  to later check this via a conditional during Descope flow execution.
- All other custom attributes defined in either Firestore or the Realtime Database Schema. Here is an example of that schema (with strings and booleans):

```
https://test-62234-example.firebaseio.com/
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄusers
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄuser1
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄuid: "user1"
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄchangedPassword: true
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄemail: "example@descope.com"
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄnewsletter: true
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄtheme: "dark"
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄuser2
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄuid: "user2"
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄchangedPassword: false
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄemail: "test@descope.com"
```

If you're going to migrate any other custom attributes, you'll need to create those attributes as well in the Descope Console before you run this script.

Once you've set all of that up, you're ready to run the script.

## Running the Migration Script üöÄ

### Dry run the migration script

You can dry run the migration script which will allow you to see the number of users, tenants, roles, etc which will be migrated
from Firebase to Descope.

```
python3 src/main.py --dry-run
```

The output would appear similar to the following:

```
Would migrate 112 users from Firebase to Descope
```

### Live run the migration Script

To migrate your Firebase users, simply run the following command:

```
python3 src/main.py
```

> **NOTE**: If you're using Realtime Database, see Step 5(c) above, as you will need to provide the `FIREBASE_DB_URL` in your environment variables before you begin.

The tool will first ask if you want to migrate custom attributes over. If you type `y`, then you'll need to provide the tool with the source of the attributes (either Firestore or Realtime Database). After that, the tool will begin migrating your users.

The output will include the responses of the created usersas well as the mapping between the various objects within Descope.

A log file will also be generated in the format of `migration_log_%d_%m_%Y_%H:%M:%S.log`. Any items which failed to be migrated will also be listed with the error that occurred during the migration.

```
Starting migration of 112 users found via Firebase Admin SDK
Still working, migrated 10 users.
...
Still working, migrated 110 users.
=================== User Migration =============================
Firebase Users found via Admin SDK 112
Successfully migrated 112 users
Successfully merged 0 users
Created users within Descope 112
```

### Post Migration Verification

Once the migration tool has ran successfully, you can check the [users](https://app.descope.com/users) for the migrated users from Firebase. You can verify the created users based on the output of the migration tool.

You can also migrate over your other Firebase configurations, manually in the console. For example:

- **Authorized Domains** - you can move these over to the [Approved Domains](https://app.descope.com/settings/project) section in the Descope Console

Unit testing can be performed by running the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest tests.test_migration
```

You can edit the values if you wish, to test whether or not the Firebase Admin SDK is working properly.
